The set of "cf/" is a utility to help you to maintenance your customization of "fml".
This directory is not necessary to install "fml".
It must be useful in the same sense of customizing /etc/sendmail.cf.


If you would like to convert your fml-Release-1-format "config.ph" to the new style,

	% sbin/config -r config.ph > my-setting

The file "my-setting" is a summary under the new style format.  
It consists of entries different from the default settings (cf/MANIFEST). 

Please check and edit "my-setting" for your preference. 
To generate the config.ph 

	% sbin/config my-setting > config.ph

This config.ph includes all the entries of fml customizing variables
irrespective of the demand.
