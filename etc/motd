[ sbin/ccfml suggests ]

Your OS has POSIX-like setuid mechanism.

    please use :include: form in /etc/aliases
    #sample is seen in ./etc/include.sample and ./etc/aliases.sample

If it does not work well, you may have to use 

    "root-setuid fml (C wrapper)"

which is compiled with -DPOSIX. 
THIS IS DANGER! Please pay attention a lot on this!
see doc/op for the detail


[ sbin/configure_fml2 reports ]

	"config.ph"  is set to recommended config.ph
	"sitedef.ph" has command settings (e.g. TAR, GZIP,..)

	*** Anyway you have done the fundamental settings now! ***

	I've create "sample" settings for your conveninece mentioned above
