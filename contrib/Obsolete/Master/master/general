			  UNIX ListServer 6.0

Here is a brief description of the set of requests recognized by UNIX
ListServer. Everything appearing in [] below is optional; everything appearing
in <> is mandatory; all arguments are case insensitive. The vertical bar ("|")
is used as a logical OR operator between the arguments. Requests may be
abbreviated, but you must specify at least the first three characters.

Keep in mind that when referring to a <list>, that list may be of two kinds:
local or remote, unless otherwise noted. When referring to a local list, your
request will be immediately processed; when referring to a remote list (a list
served by another ListServer which this system knows about), your request will
be appropriately forwarded. Issue a 'lists' request to get a listing of all
local and known remote lists to this ListServer.

Recognized requests are:


help [topic]
--------------
Without arguments, this file. Otherwise get specific information on the
selected topic. Topics may also refer to requests. To learn more about this
system issue a 'help listserver' request. To get a listing of all available
topics, generate an error message by sending a bogus request like 'help me'.


set <list> [<option> <arg[s]>]
-----------------------------
Without the optional arguments, get a list of all current settings for
the specified list. Otherwise change the option to a new value for that
list. Issue a 'help set' request for more information.


subscribe <list> <your name>
----------------------------
The only way to subscribe to a list. 


unsubscribe <list>
signoff <list>
------------------
Two ways of removing yourself from the specified list.


recipients <list>
review <list>
-----------------
Get a listing of all non-concealed people subscribed to the specified list.


information <list>
------------------
Get information about the specified list.


statistics <list> {[subscriber email address(es)] | [-all]}
-----------------------------------------------------------
Get a listing of non-concealed subscribers along with the number of messages
each one of them has sent to the specified list. If the optional email addresses
are given, then statistics will be collected for these users only. For example:
		stat foo user1@domain user2@domain
will generate statistics about these two subscribers. "-all" lists statistics
for all users that have posted on the list (whether currently subscribed ot
not).

run <list> [<password> <cmd [args]>]
-------------------------------------
Run the specified command with the optional arguments and receive the output
from stdout and/or stderr. To get a listing of all available commands to run,
omit the arguments, i.e. issue a 'run <list>' request. You have to belong to
the specified list, and must have obtained the password from the list's owner;
the owner's address may be found in the Errors-To: header line of each
delivered message. <list> may be local only.


lists
-----
Get a list of all local mailing lists that are served by this server, as well
as of all known remote lists.


index [archive | path-to-archive] [/password] [-all]
----------------------------------------------------
Get a list of files in the selected archive, or the master archive if no
archive was specified. If an archive is private, you have to provide its
password as well.


get <archive | path-to-archive> <file> [/password] [parts]
----------------------------------------------------------
Get the requested file from the specified archive. Files are usually split in
parts locally, and in such a case you will receive the file in multiple email
messages -- an 'index' request tells you how many parts the file has been split
into, and their sizes; if you need to obtain certain parts, specify them as
optional arguments. If an archive is private, you have to provide its password
as well.

search <archive | path-to-archive>] [/password] [-all] <pattern>
----------------------------------------------------------------
Search all files of the specified archive (and all of its subarchives if -all
is specified) for lines that match the pattern. The pattern can be an
egrep(1)-style regular expression with support for the following additional
operators: '~' (negation), '|' and '&' (logical OR and AND), '<' '>' (group
regular expressions). The pattern may be enclosed in single or double quotes.
Note: . matches any character including new line.

fax <fax-number> <archive | path-to-archive> <file> [/password] [parts]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Same as 'get', but it faxes you the files instead to the specified number.

release
-------

which
-----
Get a listing of local mailing lists to which you have subscribed.
