=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Net::LDAP> is a collection of modules that implements a LDAP services API
for Perl programs. The module may be used to search directories or
perform maintenance functions such as add, deleting or modify entries in
an LDAP directory.

This document assumes that the reader has some knowledge of the LDAP
protocol.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=over 4

=item new ( HOST [, OPTIONS ] )

Creates a new B<Net::LDAP> object and opens a connection to the named host.
OPTIONS is a list of key-value pairs, valid options are :-

=over 4

=item port

Port to connect to on the remote server.

=item timeout

Timeout passed to C<IO::Socket> when connecting the remote server.
(Default: 120)

=item debug

If passed a non-zero value then debug data will be sent to C<STDERR>. The
bits of this value are :-

 1   Show outgoing packets.
 2   Show incoming packets.

=item async

Perform all operations asynchronously if passed a I<true> value.

=back

Example

  $ldap = Net::LDAP->new('remote.host', async => 1);

=back

=head1 METHODS

Each of the following methods take as arguments some number of fixed
parameters followed by options, these options are passed in a named
fashion, for example

  $mesg = $ldap->bind( "me", password => "mypasswd");

The return value from these methods is an object derived from the
L<Net::LDAP::Message> class. The methods of this class allow
you to examine the status of request.


=over 4

=item abandon ( ID [, OPTIONS ] )

Request server to abandon a request. The id to abandon may be passed as the
first parameter or as part of the options list. The C<ID> may be a number
or a object which is a sub-class of C<Net::LDAP::Message>, returned from
a previous method call.

=over 4

=item id

This option is here for B<compatibility only>, and may be removed in future.
Previous releases did not take the C<ID> argument which replaces this option.

=item control

See L<CONTROLS|/CONTROLS> below

=item callback

See L<CALLBACKS|/CALLBACKS> below

=back

B<Example>

  $mesg = $ldap->search( @search_args );
  
  $ldap->abandon( $mesg ); # This could be written as $mesg->abandon


=item add ( DN [, OPTIONS ] )

Add an entry to the directory. The C<DN> argument can be either a
L<Net::LDAP::Entry> object or a string.

=over 4

=item dn

This option is here for B<compatibility only>, and may be removed in future.
Previous releases did not take the C<DN> argument which replaces this option.

=item attrs

This argument is a reference to a list of attribute-value pairs. Attributes
with multiple values can be added as either multiple entries or the value
could be a reference to a list of values.

This argument is not used if C<DN> is a L<Net::LDAP::Entry> object.

=item control

      name  => 'Graham Barr',
      attr  => 'value1',
      attr  => 'value2',
      multi => [qw(value1 value2)]
    ]
  );

  $ldap->bind; # Anonymous bind
  
  $ldap->bind( $DN, password => $password);
  
  # $sasl is an object of class Authen::SASL
  $ldap->bind( $DN, sasl => $sasl, version => 3);


=item compare ( DN, OPTIONS )

Perform a comparison on the server.  C<DN> is the DN which the comparison is
to be performed. C<DN> May be a string or a L<Net::LDAP::Entry>
object.

=over 4

=item dn

This option is here for B<compatibility only>, and may be removed in future.
Previous releases did not take the C<DN> argument which replaces this option.

L<Net::LDAP::Entry> object.

=over 4

=item dn

This option is here for B<compatibility only>, and may be removed in future.
Previous releases did not take the C<DN> argument which replaces this option.

=item newrdn

This value should be a new RDN to assign to C<DN>.

=item deleteoldrdn

This value should be I<true> if the existing RDN is to be deleted.

=item newsuperior

If given this value should be the DN of the new superior for C<DN>.

=item control

See L<CONTROLS|/CONTROLS> below.

=item callback

See L<CALLBACKS|/CALLBACKS> below.

=back

B<Example>

=item add

The C<add> option should be a reference to a HASH. The values of the
HASH are the attributes to add, and the values may be a string or a reference
to a list of values.

=item delete

A reference to an ARRAY of attributes to delete or a reference to a
HASH (as in C<add>) if only specific values should be deleted. If the
value for any attribute in the HASH is a reference to an empty ARRAY
the all instances of the attribute will be deleted.

=item replace

The <replace> option takes a argument in the same form as C<add>, but will
cause any existing attributes with the same name to be replaced. If the
value for any attribute in the HASH is a reference to an empty ARRAY
the all instances of the attribute will be deleted.

=item changes

This is an alternative to C<add>, C<delete> and C<replace> where the
whole operation can be given in a single argument. The argument should
be a reference to an ARRAY.

Values in the ARRAY are used in pairs, the first is the operation
C<add>, C<delete> or C<replace> and the second is a reference to an
ARRAY of attribute values.

The attribute value list is also used in pairs. The first value in each
pair is the attribute name and the second is a reference to a list of values.

Use this form if you want to control the order in which the operations will
be performed.

=item control

See L<CONTROLS|/CONTROLS> below.

=item callback

See L<CALLBACKS|/CALLBACKS> below.

=back

B<Example>

 $ldap->modify( $dn, add => { sn => 'Barr' } );
 
 $ldap->modify( $dn, delete => [qw(faxNumber)]);
 
 $ldap->modify( $dn, delete => { 'telephoneNumber' => '911' });
 
 $ldap->modify( $dn, replace => { 'email' => 'gbarr@pobox.com' });
 
 $ldap->modify( $dn,
   changes => [
     add     => [ sn => 'Barr' ],              # Add sn=Barr
     delete  => [ faxNumber => []], 	       # Delete all fax numbers
     delete  => [ telephoneNumber => ['911']], # delete phone number 911
     replace => [ email => 'gbarr@pobox.com']  # change email address
   ]
 );

=item search ( OPTIONS )

The search method will return an object of class L<Net::LDAP::Search>.

=over 4

=item base

The base DN to start the search.

=item scope

The scope for the search. This can be one of C<base>, C<one> or C<sub> or
it can be the numeric value for each of these 0,1,2 respectively. The default
is C<sub>.

=item deref

What to do when a reference is found. This value can be one of C<never>,
C<search>, C<find> or C<always>. Or it can be the numeric value fro each
of these. The default is C<find>.

=item sizelimit

Set the size limit for the response. zero means no limit. The default is
no limit.

=item timelimit

Set the time limit for the response. zero means no limit. The default is
no limit.

=item typesonly

If I<true> then only the attribute type will be returned. Default is I<false>.

=item filter

The filter to use for the search. This may be a string or a <Net::LDAP::Filter>
object.

=item attrs

A reference to a list of attributes to be returned from the server. If not
specified then all attributes will be returned.

=item control

See L<CONTROLS|/CONTROLS> below.

=item callback

See L<CALLBACKS|/CALLBACKS> below.

=back

B<Example>

 $mesg = $ldap->search(
   base   => $base_dn,
   scope  => 'sub',
   filter => '(|(objectclass=rfc822mailgroup)(sn=jones))'
 );
 
 Net::LDAP::LDIF->new(\*STDOUT,"w")->write($mesg->entries);

=item unbind

The unbind method does not take any parameters and will unbind you
from the server. You may then either re-bind with another DN and password
or close the connection.

B<Example>

 $ldap->unbind;

=back

The following methods are for convenience.

=over 4

=item async

Returns I<true> if the LDAP operations are being performed asynchronously.

=item debug ( [ VALUE ] )

If C<VALUE> is given the debug bit-value will be set to C<VALUE> and the
previous value will be returned. If not given the bit-value will remain
unchanged and will be returned.

=item sync ( [ MESG ] )

Calling this method will synchronize the client with the server. It will
not return until all requests have been completed, or id C<MESG> is given
it will return when C<MESG> has been completed.

Returns an error code defined in L<Net::LDAP::Constant>.

=item version

Returns the version of the LDAP protocol that is being used.

=back

=head1 CONTROLS

Many of the methods described above accept a C<control> option.
This allows the user to pass controls to the server as described
in LDAPv3. The value to the C<control> argument may be either a
HASH reference to a reference to an array of HASH references.

The HASH, or each HASH in the array may contain three elements.

=over 4

=item type

This element must be present and is the name of the type of control
being requested.

=item critical

C<critical> is optional and should be a boolean value, if it is not specified
then it is assumed to be I<false>.

=item value

If the control being requested requires a value then this element should
hold the value for the server.

=back

=head1 CALLBACKS

Most of the above commands accept a C<callback> option. This option
should be a reference to a subroutine. This subroutine will be called
for each packet received from the server as a response to the request
sent.

When the subroutine is called the first argument will be the
L<Net::LDAP::Message> object which was returned from the method.

If the request is a search then multiple packets can be received from
the server. Each entry is received as a separate packet. For each of these
the subroutine will be called with a L<Net::LDAP::Entry> object as the second
argument.

During a search the server may also send a list of references. When such
a list is received then the subroutine will be called with a
L<Net::LDAP::Reference> object as the second argument.

=head1 LDAP ERROR CODES

B<Net::LDAP> also exports constants for the error codes that can be received
from the server, see L<Net::LDAP::Constant>.
