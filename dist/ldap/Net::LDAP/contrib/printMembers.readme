Here's another script I'd like to submit. This one is called
printMembers.pl

Given a name of a group (just like isMember.pl) it will print out all of
the members of the group including members of groups who are members of
the original group. By default it will print out the DN of the member
entries, but you have the option of specifying an attribute on the
command line to print instead (e.g. print out the mail attribute
instead).

Here's an example of default output:
perl printMembers.pl -n "Accounting Managers"

Members of group: cn=Accounting Managers,ou=groups,o=airius.com
uid=scarter, ou=People, o=airius.com
uid=tmorris, ou=People, o=airius.com
cn=HR Managers,ou=groups,o=airius.com

Members of group: cn=HR Managers,ou=groups,o=airius.com
uid=kvaughan, ou=People, o=airius.com
uid=cschmith, ou=People, o=airius.com
cn=PD Managers,ou=groups,o=airius.com

Members of group: cn=PD Managers,ou=groups,o=airius.com
uid=kwinters, ou=People, o=airius.com
uid=trigden, ou=People, o=airius.com

Here's an example of the same group but instead print the cn attribute
of each entry:

Members of group: cn=Accounting Managers,ou=groups,o=airius.com
Sam Carter
Ted Morris
HR Managers

Members of group: cn=HR Managers,ou=groups,o=airius.com
Kirsten Vaughan
Chris Schmith
PD Managers

Members of group: cn=PD Managers,ou=groups,o=airius.com
Kelly Winters
Torrey Rigden

And same group but with the mail attribute:

Members of group: cn=Accounting Managers,ou=groups,o=airius.com
scarter@airius.com
tmorris@airius.com

Members of group: cn=HR Managers,ou=groups,o=airius.com
kvaughan@airius.com
cschmith@airius.com

Members of group: cn=PD Managers,ou=groups,o=airius.com
kwinters@airius.com
trigden@airius.com


This is my favorite script. But I'm sure it can be improved. Anyway let
me know.

Mark
