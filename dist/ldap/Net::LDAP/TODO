Net::LDAP::Simulate
  If Net::LDAP dumped a log of all packets in a binary form then
  we could simulate a connection. This means a session can be re-run
  without being connected to the server. Could be useful with debug

Net::LDAP::Schema
  Decide on final implementation

Net::LDAP::LDIF
  Still need to add support for moddn
