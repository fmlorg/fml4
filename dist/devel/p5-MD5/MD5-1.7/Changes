Revision history for Perl extension MD5.

*** 96/06/20 Version 1.7

MD5 is now completely 64-bit clean (I hope). The basic MD5 code uses
32-bit quantities and requires a typedef UINT4 to be defined in
global.h. Perl configuration data (the value of BYTEORDER) is used to
determine if unsigned longs have 4 or 8 bytes. On 64-bit platforms (eg
DEC Alpha) then it assumes that "unsigned int" will be a 32-bit type.
If this is incorrect then adding -DUINT4_IS_LONG to the DEFINES line in
Makefile.PL will override this.

On some machines (at least Cray that I know of) there is no 32-bit
integer type. In this case defining TRUNCATE_UINT4 (which is done
automatically for a Cray) will ensure that 64-bit values are masked
down to 32 bits. I have done my best to test this but without easy
access to a true 64-bit machine I can not totally guarantee it (unless
anyone wants to lend me a spare Cray :-)

There is one remaining limitation for 64-bit enabled processors. The
amount of data passed to any single call to the underlying MD5
routines is limited to (2^32 - 1) bytes -- that's 4 gigabytes. I'm
sorry if that's a real problem for you ...

And finally, a minor complilation warning (unsigned char * used with
function having char * prototype) has also been eliminated.

*** 96/04/09 Version 1.6

Re-generated module framework using h2xs to pick up the latest module
conventions for versions etc. You can now say "use MD5 1.6;" and things
should work correctly. MD5.pod has been integrated into MD5.pm and
CHANGES renamed to Changes. There is a fairly comprehensive test.pl
which can be invoked via "make test". There are no functional changes
to the MD5 routines themselves.

*** 96/03/14 Version 1.5.3

Fixed addfile method to accept type-glob references for the file-handle
(eg \*STDOUT). This is more consistent with other routines and is now the
recommended way of passing file-handles. The documentation now gives more
examples as to how the routines might be used.

*** 96/03/12 Version 1.5.2

Minor fixes from Christopher J Madsen <madsen@computek.net> to provide
support for building on OS/2 (and to work arround a perl -w bug).

Remove warning about possible difference between add('foo', 'bar') and
add('foobar'). This is not true (it may have been true in the earliest
version of the module but is no longer the case).

*** 96/03/08 Version 1.5.1

Add CHANGES file to make it easier for people to figure out what has
been going on. (Meant to do this as part of 1.5)

*** 96/03/05 Version 1.5

Add hash() and hexhash() methods at the suggestion/request of Gary
Howland <gary@kampai.euronet.nl> before inclusion in a wider library
of cryptography modules.

*** 96/02/27 Version 1.4

Finally fixed the pesky Solaris dynamic loading bug. All kudos to Ken
Pizzini <kenp@spry.com>!

*** 95/11/29 Version 1.3.1

Add explanations of current known problems.

*** 95/06/02 Version 1.3

Fix problems with scope resolution in addfile() reported by
Jean-Claude Giese <Jean-Claude.Giese@loria.fr>. Basically ARGV is
always implicitly in package main while other filehandles aren't.
