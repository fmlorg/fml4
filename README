		How to edit fml CVS repository
		$Date$

CAUTION: you need "BSD make" not gmake.



1. how to hack 

   % cvs -d cvs.fml.org:/cvsroot co fml

	check out cvs tree, edit it and commit it! 
	Please add your changes to "CHANGES". 

2. If you make "snapshot" without .tar.gz

   % cp distrib/mk/fmlmk.conf.example ~/.fmlmk.conf

	Please edit ~/.fmkmk.conf to modify several PATH's
	to fit your environemnt.


3. how to make snapshot with tar.gz

   % cvs -d cvs.fml.org:/cvsroot co fml
   % cp distrib/mk/fmlmk.conf.example ~/.fmlmk.conf
	... edit ~/.fmlmk.conf ...
   % cd fml
   % make snapshot

 XXX If you have no BSD make, 
 XXX run "make bsdmake" here before you run make.

4. how to make release tarball

   % cvs -d cvs.fml.org:/cvsroot co fml
   % cd fml
   % cp distrib/mk/fmlmk.conf.example ~/.fmlmk.conf
	... edit ~/.fmlmk.conf ...
   % echo 4.0.x > conf/release
   % echo 4.0.x > conf/release_version
   % make release


Appendix A:  install "bsd make" on Debian GNU/linux

  I verified you can make bsd make by GNU make on linux famillies.

   % cvs -d cvs.fml.org:/cvsroot co fml
   % cd fml
   % (cd dist/NetBSD; make bsdmake)
   % su
   # cp dist/NetBSD/src/usr.bin/make/bmake /usr/local/bin
   # cp -pr dist/NetBSD/src/share/mk /usr/share


Appendix B: conf/ (maintainer is responsible for these files)

conf/

	release			4.0 4.0A 4.0.1
	release_version		(automatically updated)
	branch			current / stable
	mode			'' / "daily"

"conf/release" is the main trunk revision, which should be set up by hand.
"branch" indicates current or stable, which should be set up by hand.
"mode" is for daily snapshot system.
distrib/bin/fml_version.pl updates "conf/release_version" automatically.
