Caution: you need "BSD make" not gmake.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Firstly cvs checkout !

0.	set up TCP/IP to the Internet if needed. 

1.	checkout fml repository

	% setenv CVSROOT cvs.fml.org:/cvsroot
	% cvs co fml
	% cd fml

1.1	If you are the maintainer to make 'snapshot', you need distrib/history.
	The repository distrib/history is special. Please check out it:

	% cd distrib
	% cvs co history

where 'history' is the alias of 'release/history'.

2.	generate pkgsrc/. NOTE: You need Intenet connection to 'make pkgsrc'. 

	% make pkgsrc

3.	set up $FML/.info and make documents

	% touch .info	(or get the latest .info)
	% make plaindoc
	% make htmldoc

4.	O.K., now start your hack!


5.	When you make distribution, you need several programs
	such as ssh, rsync, .... Please see distrib/mk/fml.prog.mk 
	for more details.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
* The fml master maintainer who is responsible for e.g. snapshot generation
  should check the version number

0.	check conf/.

	conf/release			2.2A      ;;; main trunk version
	conf/release_version		2.2A#100  ;;; snapshot (not in cvs)

"conf/release" is the main trunk revision, which should be set up by hand.
distrib/bin/fml_version.pl controls "conf/release_version".

1.	define the current snapshot number "conf/release_version".

You need to set "conf/release" based on information not in cvs.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
* CVS on cvs.fml.org  NetBSD-current/newsmips (1.3I)

^fml
		-> source-changes@fml.org 
		-> /cvsroot/log/fml/commitlog

^fml/doc
		-> doc-changes@fml.org 
		-> source-changes@fml.org 
		-> /cvsroot/log/fml/commitlog

^fml/distrib/history
		-> /cvsroot/log/fml/commitlog

-----------------------------------------------------------------
* TAG, BRANCH

When you make "fml x.y.z release", you will work on the branch split
off from the main trunk. For example

	   2.2 -----> 2.2 A --*--> 2.2B ----->	(main trunk)
	                      |
	                  2.2.1 BETA		(branch)
	                      |			(* == fml-2-2-bb0)
	                  2.2.1 Release

If you do "make snapshot", the following "make_wrapper" may be useful.

	#!/bin/sh
	FML=$PWD;            export FML
	BRANCH_SNAPSHOT=yes; export BRANCH_SNAPSHOT
	exec make $*

If $BRANCH_SNAPSHOT is set, distrib/bin/generator does not synchronize
the fml distribution with www and ftp/snapshot/ directory.
